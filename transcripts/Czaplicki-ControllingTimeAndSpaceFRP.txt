EVAN CZAPLICKI: OK, can you hear me OK?

>> Cool.  OK, so I'm going to get started.  I'm Evan Czaplicki.  Over the course of thinking about function reactive programming, I've learned some things, so this talk is really distilling those years into like a 40-minute thing so you don't have to go through the same thing that I did.  And I went with controlling time and space, because at the time I was feeling like some kind of time Lord with like time travel and but the real focus is understanding what FRP is, and there's actually quite a lot of diversity about what that term actually means so diving into that and sort of being able to pick that apart.  So our goals today are to understand what is FRP, how do we categorize different things that fall into that umbrella and then how do we evaluate those things in a nice way?  So the way we're going to get started, learning these things is start with sort of what I'm calling first-order FRF and this is kind of what Elm looks like and then we'll branch out into a bunch of different variations that sort of build on core.  So first thing is first-order FRP.  Another way to think about that is how it works in Elm.  We'll see why it's first order in just a bit.  When we're dealing with FRP, what we really want is a way to deal with interaction with the world.  So we have a user over here and they're typing and they're looking at things, so we're getting key presses, mouse events and bringing that into some sort of processing system, so in Elm, this is called a signal graph.  In Javascript it might be a thing with callbacks.  So rather than using callbacks in these ad hock ways of structuring times, we actually have system that gives a structure that we can evaluate.  So we get this core of signal graphs.
>> So the key part of a signal graph is that it has inputs from the world.  So these are things like mouse.position and if you look at the type of this, that means has typed, and it's not just a pair of integers, but it's a signal of a pair of integers.  So as you move your mouse, that value is updating.  Another example of this is keyboard.last pressed and you can think of this the same way.  Time is passing and we're seeing the value change over time.  So in this case, I was typing hello Strangeloop, and then I got distracted and then I surfed the web for a bit and I came back at a later point so you're seeing this change over time and having a way to talk about that explicitly.
>> So from inputs, we can do a little bit of -- that's sort of like the raw information coming from the world but on top of that we want to be able to transform those things, so with for that we use this function lift.  So let's -- we take in a signal, so we can take in our key presses signal and then we have a function that goes from As to Bs.  So we take the values of A and we go make a signal of B.  So example of this would be saying, we have this function is consonant, so we're checking each of these letters, and what we get out is a new signal, so we say, OK, H, that's a consonant, E, that's not, L, L, so on and so on.  So we can actually transform these values as they change over time.  So what we're doing is really handling a time-bearing thing rather than do an event based callback system.  The next thing we can deal with is state.  So in Elm, this is called fold p.  You can read this from fold from the past.  And what's going on here is let's take our trusty key presses signal, and when we actually fold P we're going to give it a starting state, this is this guy, and a way to update that state.  So whenever a key press comes in, I'm going to say, cool, I got the key, I got the state that I'm working with and I'm going to increment that by 1, so when we look at the signal that we get out, we count, 1, 2, 3, so on and so forth.  So this is a very simple example of carrying state but you can think of something quite a bit more complicated where perhaps you have a to do list application and you want to model what your program is doing as things change over time.
>> Finally, we have a way to merge signals together, so the very basic one is called merge which it takes two signals and it just kind of merges them together.  This is one of the well-named primitives.
[laughter]
>> There's another one called lift 2, questionably named primitive.  This takes two signals and it takes the functions from both of them and produces a signal.  So this is to say if I have a signal of X coordinate and Y coordinate, I can can apply a signal that puts them together.  And so in addition to lift 2, there's lift lots of them.  It stops at 8.  But you can go higher through various tricks.  So what we have is a way of talking about this graph, setting up an input from the world, transforming it, updating some state, merging things together and this gives us the tools to build this signal graph.  And so if you imagine a program like a to-do list, like this, you can think of this program as we model the inputs, we go update some state, we transform that into something to show on screen, and sort of we have this architecture for application.
>> So that's sort of the operational details, that's kind of what you would learn, the very abbreviated version of what you would learn if you dug into Elm, but it doesn't really get at these principles that went into that design so when you think about the core design you start to see some details that aren't apparent immediately.  The first one is that signals are connected to the world.  This is a key property of Elm system that doesn't appear everywhere else, but you have direct connection to mouse position or keyboard.  Signals are infinite.  This one is subtle but it essentially means that there's no such thing as deleting a signal.  There's no -- you can't have an input that you then later throw away.  This is like saying I have the mouse, but then I took the mouse off of my laptop, like it doesn't -- like the -- essentially it's saying the inputs to your program are fixed.
>> Another property is signal graphs are static.  There's a known structure for your application from startup all the way into the future and this sounds like, oh, it dynamic.  We'll get to that.  There are tons of tradeoffs that get to that.  So this is actually a property that gives you lots and lots of power that we'll get into in a bit.  Finally it's synchronous to a fault.  What that means is when you type hello, as someone who's observing, you want them to you need to be sure that those events flow through and maintain order so in Elm that's maintained by default.  That property isn't shared by all variations.
>> So OK, what do we get?  What do we get when we make these design choices?  So the first one is efficiency.  This one, it doesn't -- it's not clear at this point why I'm saying this, but eventually what's happening is everything is event-driven, right?  Event comes to world, it flows through our graph, it may get sent back as an enter state.  So we'll see why it's necessary to point out that efficiency is a property that we have.
>> Another thing is architecture.  So this is a Elm program that's kind of like the typical example of a MVC-style application.  And this is just hooking up to the world, and so you can see it's actually using local storage, so if I reload this page, the changes propagate over, because I'm saving it, so which is to say, interacting with the world becomes quite simple.  Now, when we look at the structure of this application, it breaks up nicely into four parts.  As of every Elm program will.  It breaks up into a model.  That's tiny.  Is that better-ish?  OK, we just want to overview here, we don't need to see the details exactly so we first have a model, saying here's the state of my application.  I have a list of tasks.  What is the task.  What I'm editing.  So we're explicitly modeling what our application means and from there we have update, how do I take that state and step it forward based on stuff people want to do, so maybe we want to add a task or delete a task and finally we have a view, which is how do I take the state of my application and turn it into HTML that I can show on the screen and what's nice here is we can make sort of reusable function, so I can say how do I show a task on screen and then I can say map for that over all of my visible tasks so I can start to build up UI in a really nice declarative way with these pure functions.  So that architecture, that structure, comes from the static signal graphs, they guide you towards writing your applications that way.  I consider that a really big benefit.  Another thing that you get is hot swapping so you guys may have seen the Mario program from last year.  If you didn't, it's a good way to learn Elm in like that isn't only like 10 minutes.  So notice I walked him over to the side of the screen, and I'm going to change gravity a little bit, and now jump him and then change it again, and suddenly gravity is stronger, so we're able to change the behavior of the program while the program is running, and sort of see those changes propagate automatically.
>> So the final thing that we get -- well, not the final thing, but like the other thing I felt necessary to share with you guys today, is the time travel debugger, so you may have seen this online, but we've got a new version coming out that's easy to install and so I just wanted to do a tiny demo of that.
>> So here's that trusty Mario program.  And we've got like mega Mario.  Aww, man, I changed the code by accident last night, I forgot to change it back.  But we can see where mega Mario was before and we can pause this program and sort of go back in time to wherever we want to go, so say we go like near the beginning and we pick up where we started there.  So we say OK, I didn't want it to walk to the left, I wanted to walk to the right.  So one cool thing here is we can look at data in our program, so if I zoom, if I go back a little bit, you can see the arrows value, I'm now pressing right and if I go back a little more I'm pressing up right now and then I stop pressing up, so you can start to get really cool insights as to what's going on in your program at particular points in time and what's neat about this, you can, oh, yeah, there's another thing that's neat about it that I forgot to tell you.
>>
[laughter]
>> OK, so you see I'm jumping around.  OK, so here's the code, again it's got model, display, these parts.  And I want to change, I want to change gravity again so when I save that and this is in sublime text, those changes propagate but they propagate for the whole history so we can see that Mario can jump way too high and we're like that's no good, we want to see that Mario has a reasonable kind of jump.  So now we've got super Mario who jumps.
>> OK.
>>
[applause].
>> So these are kind of like the core things that come from having a static signal graph.  A lot of these abilities to swap in code and replay code comes from the fact that if we know what the program looks like at the start we know what it's going to look like in an hour, in a day and we don't have to do some kind of crazy complex analysis to figure that out or to match things out.  So that's the sot of an overview of what first-order FRP is like, but the question you may have in the back of your head, you know, what happens if signal graphs could be reconfigured?  What is higher order FRP?  Surely higher is better.  So this is the question that sort of guides a lot of thinking on FRP and a lot of the research because it's a very, very surprisingly hard question.  So there are a couple ways that it has been pursued, we're going to explore them one by one and they sort of fall into nice separate categories.  So let's dive in.  The first one is higher order FRP, so this is just saying OK, we took this core design and we don't like that signal graphs are static.  We want to get rid of that constraint, so what do we need to add?  What do we lose?  One thing I should point out is that with all of these variations it's not better or worse, it's trades, right?  Whenever you're making a decision, it's like I'm going to get this feature and I'm going to lose this other one.  So what happens when we get rid of this core design that signal graphs are static?  So typically this is with a function called join.  So not super clear exactly what that might mean, but here we have a signal of signals.  Again it's not super clear what that might mean, but you can think of it as, I have a group of signals and I'm picking which one to listen to right now, so you can think of this signal as the guy coming out here and this signal as like choosing one of these, so as I get updates, I listen to a different signal coming in.
>> So that seems straightforward, right?  It sounds plausible?
>> So already at this point we have some questions, so what happens to these signals that aren't in use right now?  Right?  No one's listening, so should it keep running?  Should it pause?
>> This is a surprisingly difficult question.  Now you get into even crazier issues when you start adding signals that hadn't previously been observed and you can keep adding these and adding these.  So to make this a bit more concrete, let's use another example where we see the bad behavior here so here we have a very simple signal.  It's counting mouse clicks.  And let's see something a bit more complicated.  So here we've got something that's either counting mouse clicks or it's zero.  So if I put true in I'm going to get count mouse clicks, if I put mouse in, I'm going to get a constant signal of 0.  So let's say we start with true and I click 5 times, so I should be at 5.  Now I go false it's 0, and I click 5 more times and I go true again.  OK, what should the value be of my signal?  Should it be 0 because I'm restarting?  Should it be 5 because I'm picking up where I left off?  Should it be 10 because that's the total number of clicks that have happened over the total of the course of this application?  Now, because of a lot of this research happens in purely functional languages or languages where we want to have properties about equational reasoning, our answer is chosen for us, so if you look at this code, count mouse clicks and this code, count mouse clicks, they're the same expression, so it should be possible to replace this variable with click count and have this same behavior.  So essentially our behavior is chosen for us.  When we get to that point where we go true again, it needs to be at 10, it needs to be the count of the full number of clicks.
>> So where this starts to get crazy is let's say no one defined that, but they wrote this program.
>> So I start my program, this signal is false.  So it's 0000, I wait 10 minutes, I wait 20 minutes I'm clicking away like a maniac and suddenly I change to count mouse clicks, this is a signal it's never seen before but I know that it needs to keep track of all of those past clicks.  So I'm in a place that I don't necessarily know that I'm going to need that signal.  I know that I need to know that past history.  I may need to look at all the past events to be able to reconstruct the signal so that I have all this history.  Another way to think of this is memory is linear in time.  I need to keep track of that in case you have to look back.  The solution isn't that this is a bad idea, it's that we only should switch to signals that have safe amounts of history.  It's not that switching is necessarily bad, but that particular kind of switching definitely causes problems.
>> So what this has turned into is how do we restrict the definition of join with fancier type?  How do we write a way to switch between things that rules out the possibility of this infinite look-back so we can implement it efficiently and this is where a lot of the research has gone on this topic and when you see a modern library in Haskell or wherever else, that is in this category of higher order FRP it's going to be doing a trick like this, so one cool example of it is this paper higher order functional reactive programming in bounded space.  The names get really long for these papers when your topic is functional reactive programming.  He uses a thing called linear types and this is a thing that doesn't appear in Haskell or OCaml.  The point is that this is rare type system to see.
>> So we can write programs like this, but we're making some tradeoffs, so we got rid of the idea that signal graphs are static, so we're losing the hot spot thing is really easy.  We're losing that time travel debugging is straightforward, we're losing that architecture is really straightforward and we may be dealing with a slightly more complex API or a more complex type system, so when thinking about this one, let's say there weren't any tradeoffs here.  Let's say this was like the -- the problems were solved.  Let's look back at the architecture of this to do MBC thing from before.  So when I look at this code and lets let's say I could switch on signals, would I want to architect my application that way?  Given the ability, would I use it?  So maybe that would mean that instead of a state that I model like this, it has the tasks isn't just a list of tasks, it's a list of signals of tasks, and we're doing some more complicated signal structure with that, and I'm not sure that's a better way.  I think that's something that I'd like to see some examples and that could be -- that could be quite interesting, but I'm not -- I'm not totally sold yet.  So next we have a think called asynchronous data flow, so if you know reactive extensions, reactive cocoa, bacon js, essentially if you see something look that looks like FRP and it is an imperative language it's probably in this category of things.  So again we can look at our core design and see which things we cross off because of course we cross off that signal graphs are static, because we don't want that.  Signals are infinite, so this is another way of saying that signals can end, like I can start it up, it can trigger four events and then it can die.  Finally we get rid of the design that it's synchronous by default.  This doesn't mean you can't have synchrony, but you have to do it by yourself, that's asynchronous is a hint that that's one thing we're getting rid of.  So these guys use something called flatten.  It may look very familiar.  When you're writing in imperative language, you get this extra ability of naming things in a way that is clear for people.  So flattening signals the signals, it's quite intuitive to name it that way.  So but this is the same idea, and it ends up looking a little bit different because we've given up on more of these core design points.  I shouldn't say given up.  We've decided to shoot for a different point in the design space.  So if we look back at that program from before, where we were like OK, count mouse click needs to be equal to count mouse clicks, we get all these problems, OK, now we're in an imperative language and no one ever said you were going to have this guarantee.  So whenever you're creating these signals you're creating a completely new one.  That means I start with true, I count 1, 2, p, 4, 5, I go to false so it's zero and I switch to true.  I start at 0 again, it's an entirely new signal.  So we're creating new things and there's some mechanism of cleaning up garbage as we go.  We still have that question from before of what happens when no one's listening to a signal, right?  You may have created a signal and no one's paying attention.  So some variations of this style have a thing called hot and cold signal, so reactive extensions in particular has hot and cold signals, meaning if I have a signal and no one's listening, there's a joke here.  If I have a signal and no one's listening, what should happen and if it's hot, it's going to keep produce things and if it's cold it's going to stop.
>> OK.  So finally we have arrowized FRP so this is something you can see in Haskell.  Yampa is the first one that came out, net wire is I think a more modern version that looks more interesting.  Elm has a thing called automaton which is the same concept.  We cross off that signal graphs are static.  Now in this one we cross off that signals are connected to the world.  This is a very clever and interesting choice that has some cool effects.  So we'll get into this by looking at who how this library works in Elm, so for the basic API, we've got this function called pure.  And this is creating an automaton so you can think of an automaton as a little robot who takes things in and gives things on the other side.  So I can think of an automaton of increments by 1.  You give 1, it gives you 2, you give it 42, it gives you 43, you give it 100, it gives you 101.  Here is how you write that out.  You have a function, it takes in input and it increments it by 1.  Next we have a made to model state, so this is quite like a full P.  This one is nicer to see by example.  So here I have my base value so in my brain I have 0, and then as my step function, whenever I get in a value, I'm going to say cool, that's a nice value you gave me and I'm going to take my total and increment it by 1, so someone gives me the spring hello and I say oh, I got a 1, and I give out 1 and someone says how are you?  OK, I got 2, I got 2 messages so here we can model state in the same way.  The last thing I want to show is how we chain these together.  So when you have two little automatons that are processing information you can put them next to each other.  So you can say I have one guys that takes As and gives Bs, and one guy who takes Bs and gives Cs, and you put them together.  Chain.  1, 2, 3, and process that information.
>> So this gets interesting when you want to start switching on things.  So you can think of each of these as a little automaton who has some state, and this these are all counting, so their state starts at 0.  And we're going to put them into our sort of active position.  So values will be flowing through here, so if we start out, we know this guy is 0 and then we pass a couple events through, let's say 5 events went through, so increments 1, 2, 3, 45, and we switch it out for the green one.  Now, this guy is holding 5, this guy is holding 0, this guy is holding 0.  What's clever here is these nodes aren't connected to the world.  So when we take it out of the graph, this part of what happens, does it keep running, it's answered, it doesn't keep running, it's not connected to anything and what this means is we can switch things in a more creative way.  So let's say I give this three events, 1, 2, 3, and then I switch again, so now I've got 5 in here, 3 in here, 0 and we can switch this in really interesting ways.  So this is kind of the key insight of arrowized FRP, but we gave up something really important which is that we can talk about signals coming from the world.  So in this system, there's no way to talk about mouse position.  That's something that exists externally.  So what that means is, arrowized FRP is really about structuring code and so it can show up in a library for Elm or Haskell or whatever, and it's in competition with like using pure functions and modules as a means of abstraction.  So the question to ask yourself here is, for my particular domain, is this way of structuring code giving me benefits?  And I know there's been success with music and with net wire, there may be some other cool things of structuring your code, I personally haven't used it a lot, but it's compatible with all of these different approaches.
>> So when we zoom out, you notice I put the circle around Elm to have all three colors, indicating that this isn't a competition of like which one is better, but rather, different points in a design space that are complementary.  So when we think of how this connects to Elm, how does higher order FRP connect?  I mean this is really adding a feature.  This is something that could be done.  I personally don't want to take that step and give up these the properties that Elm is able to get.  If we find a way to do it that's nice, that's totally possible to add to Elm.  With asynchronous data flow here you're giving up the synchrony guarantee, so there isn't something you'd embed in Elm, it's something he'd embed Elm in.  So let's say you're Prezi who employs me you'd like to make a little part of application.  What you can do is hook up to Elm and hook up with and have that interactivity so you can have all these nice guarantees when you want but still integrate with a system that has something more complex going on.  Finally arrowized FRP, it can just be pa library.  It is a library.  And so when we think of the broad categories here, we can think of one as static graphs, graphs that don't change over time, and other categories as dynamic graphs, graphs that do change over time, the sort of broad connecting categories, and then for distinguishing these bottom 3, you can look, are there infinite signals?  Another way to tell is is it in Haskell, it's probably in this category.  Finite event streams, so this is signals that can end.  An easier way to tell is like is it an imperative language and finally neither.  In this world we don't talk about signals, whether they're finite or infinite or not.  So this kind of gives us our taxonomy or like different points in the design space, so let's sort of pick out the lessons we can from learn from this.  I know I introduced parts of Elm really quickly.  I didn't do a lot of examples.  You request learn more at this site about Elm in particular.  If you want to learn more about the history of FRP, specifically first-order FRP and higher order FRP, this is my thesis and it has a section on history of FRP and if you look at the citations, you'll just see links to all the papers that have been published by that -- by the time this was written.
>> When it comes to categorizing things, the -- it means I'm running low on time.  When it comes to categorizing, the questions you want to be asking are, is it synchronous by default?  Right, am I getting these ordering guarantees where I know if someone types hello and clicks a button that we're going to get it in that order and not the button click happens halfway through because the processing takes too long or something.  Does it Ali asynchrony?  It's not just that you want asynchrony.  But there are times you want to block everything.  You ever need to make writes to disc and so Elm builds in this idea of asynchrony in a nice way.  And not all systems that are out there have a plan for how asynchrony will work, so that's something that you should keep in mind, especially when you're looking at higher order FRP, can I talk about inputs?  So this is essentially a way of saying like, is it a arrowized system, is it a way of structuring code or is it a way of talking about events?  Can I reconfigure my graph?  And when you want to evaluate this, the question isn't how can I get the fanciest like words on my library, it's what properties do I need for my application, right?  So when you are a owe looking at something like reactive extensions and you want to write some server code, where I've got ten people connecting to my server, they have all want some information, there asynchronous by default is great, why should any of them block depending on the order they came in.  Or if you're dealing with some system where it's not that important to have this synchronating.  That will fit you really well.  If you want to have the kind of debugging tools that Elm has, you may want to make a different choice, yeah, what is debugging like?  This is a question I can't answer for the sort of dynamic graph ones as easily, but it's something to think about when you're starting out.  Like this isn't just a cool thing to start with, you have to carry this through for the whole life of your application and finally, does the code come out nice?  So there may be something where you like it, and then once you write a lot of code, things start to feel more complicated than you thought, right?  So this is particularly important when you're talking about the asynchronous data flow kind of things.  You can get more features but you're paying a complexity cost for that and do you need that in your application?  Is it something that you can live without to get some more simplicity.
>> If you're interested in learning more about FRP, if you learn Elm, then it's easy to go to to these other ones and you learn these principles which you can learn there.  But yeah, so hopefully this has given you some insight.  Thank you very much.
>> So we've got some time for questions, I think?  Yeah?
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  [inaudible]
>> Yeah, so that's the switch of going to the sort of asynchronous data post dial.  Oh, so the question was, why with the joint order in higher order FRP, why keep that constraint that count mouse clicks goes to.  I can't say for sure if there are libraries that do that.  This is a design choice you can make, you get different tradeoffs doing that kind of thing.  That would be more in the ballpark of the sort of reactive extensions bacon js style, though.
>> Any other?
>>
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  
(inaudible)
>>
>> Yeah, so the question is, like when do you hook up an arrowized FRP system and what happens once you do hook it up?  So typically you'll define your arrowized FRP system and design that dynamism into it and then hook it up and those things will be switched in and out.  When it's hooked up isn't such a huge deal, in that you can give it values at any time, and it will step forward of its sort of world so I'm she not sure if this is answering your question very well, but yeah, so when you step an automaton forward, what you're getting is here's the value I started with.
>> Yes?
>>
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  [inaudible]
>> Right, so the question is about how do you get a kind of mod later in an application like a to-do list; is that fair?
>>
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes.
>> So I think that there are a couple of ways, right, so one is to use the higher order style, something like ore to give you that configuration.  You can wrap it in that way.  My opinion is that this is something we should explore more in Elm.  What I'm advocating right now is sticking with module system and function, so if you want to modulize your tasks, you'd make a module that is all about tasks.  What's the model of them, how do I update it, how do I view them.  And I can keep doing this sort of nesting architecture to get that kind of modularity.  And it's not clear to me that one way is going to be superior to the other and I think there hasn't been enough exploration to know like this is the right way or even if there is a right way for all cases.  Yes?
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  [inaudible]
>> OK, I'll take a look.  Yeah, I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen it.
>>
>> Yeah, so that is terminology that I think is a bit confusing, so we talked, oh, sorry, the question is, how does push versus pull fit in this taxonomy.  So with the asynchronous data put we talked about hot and cold.  With Elm it's event driven so meaning it's push, you push an event to it and that propagates it through.  What pull means is someone at the bottom says hey, I want to say something and so that goes through your graph and pulls values sampling from whatever that time period is.  The argument that we've made in the work that we've done in FRP is that a push system can model a pull one in that when you get to the bottom of your program, one way to say it is I pulled the values through.  Another way to say it is I trigger a push through and so I don't think there's as huge a difference between this as -- the distinction isn't as important as it sounds.

>> Say it again?  OK, so the question is about how do you deal with sort of like too much data to process through your graph, right, is there a way to drop things or -- so in the domain of UI, you're dealing with human input so you're not going to be getting in that situation very often, so a lot of these systems are prioritized towards use cases like that, and so I think -- so essentially the subtext here is like what is the like push-back like mechanism.  I think -- I'm not an expert on this particular question.  There may be FRP system that do it.  Elm is primarily concerned with UI so it's not the major focus.  I've gone over time a little bit.  Let's chat outside if you have questions.  Thank you very much.
